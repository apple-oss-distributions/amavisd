If using Postfix or Exim v4 or dual-sendmail setup,
you came to the wrong subdirectory,
no helper programs are needed.


sendmail with milter
====================

NOTE:
  A rewrite by Petr Rehor of the helper program amavis-milter.c to use
  the new AM.PDP protocol (README.protocol) is available as a separate
  project, see: http://sourceforge.net/projects/amavisd-milter/

  The rest of this document applies to older helper program included
  in the amavisd-new distribution, which speaks a traditional AM.CL
  protocol with amavisd daemon (see README.protocol), and offers
  limited milter functionality.


For sendmail milter setup, please use the usual procedure:

  check the configure options: ./configure --help

  ./configure
  make
  make install

This should produce the program amavis-milter.

Follow the instructions in README.milter for integrating it with sendmail.

There are two source code version of the program amavis-milter.c
available in this distribution. The older, based on 1.1.2.3.2.36, was
distributed with amavisd-new up to the version amavisd-new-20030616-p5.

The amavis-milter.c is currently being maintained by Lars Hecking. 
The 1.1.2.3.2.40 -based version is now the default (via soft link)
starting with amavisd-new-20030616-p6. There are some minor differences
in command-line options, otherwise both should work with amavisd-new.

Start it as 'amavis-milter -h' to get the up-to-date list of options!

The new version has better error handling and logging to syslog.
If there are problems with newer version, please revert to the older one.


Thanks to Stephane Lentz for providing the
configure.in/Makefile.in for this version.


older sendmail without milter
=============================

To compile just the older amavis(.c) helper program
without the benefit of the sendmail library and configure/make,
please:
- copy config.h.in to config.h
- edit config.h, adjusting the few variables as needed
- compile the program, e.g. gcc -o amavis amavis.c
  and copy it to wherever you would like to have it

Follow the instructions in README.sendmail for
integrating it with sendmail.



P.S.
There is an small experimental Perl program amavis.pl in this directory,
which is functionally similar to amavis.c, but speaks the new AM.PDP
protocol with the amavisd daemon. See its source code for comments.
